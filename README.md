# LOST PROPHECIES
A vanilla+ OpenMW (0.49 RC7) modlist. I built this list with the goal of making Morrowind a less frustrating experience for new and returning players, while also keeping the game clean of not so lore-friendly mods. The goal was to not overhaul most locations and quests in case the player want to use the UESP wiki. 

This list contains:

- Bug fixes that alter in a lore-friendly way the game
- A few visual tweaks (MET, Impact Effects, shaders, etc.)
- Gameplay overhauls (Less frustrating combat, multimark, etc.)
- User interface overhauls
- Fully voices NPCs and dialogues (VoV, VoT, AFFresh voiced, etc.)
- Rebalanced Main Quests (All three)
- Tamriel Rebuilt 25.05 and previews (with an immersive warning)
- Project Cyrodiil
- Skyrim Home of the Nords
